## CommunityVoice Overview
CommunityVoice is a web platform created as a university project to help Berlin residents report city infrastructure issues such as potholes, broken street lights, or damaged signs. The goal is to make it easy for people to share problems they notice in their neighborhoods and for city services to respond more effectively.

Right now, CommunityVoice is not officially connected to the Berlin government. However, we hope to partner with local authorities in the future so that reported issues can be addressed directly by city departments. By encouraging civic engagement and making communication simple, Community Voice aims to help keep Berlin’s public spaces safe and welcoming for everyone.
